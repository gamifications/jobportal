Need a fullstack developer for a SAAS.

Modules needed
1) simple landing page
2) User account (- user account ( email and password, email confirmation, reset password)

3) Stripe for monthly subsription
4) Dashboard ( view latest item, add new button)
    - new form  (This will be saved to the database, these can be edited later if needed..)
           nested form 1 which accepts a dictionary (key: string -- value: list of strings) --> settings
           nested form 2 which accepts a few strings and one method to open pdf/docs saving the data to a string

5) results page which will be in a table form (front end)
- this will included the data from the above form.. especially on the nested form 1.
---------------------------------------------


Dashboard
- a simple table/rows with the job name, creation date
- this is also where the user can create new job.

Docs/PDF
- user can upload the resume in textfield, docs or PDF. Logic can be applied at server or client side to open and save to database. However, if there is an error in opening, warning message should be prompted to the user.

* get data as string from pdf/docs

my concern is more to the job form.. if your live example can demonstrate this, i'm good to offer this project to you.
Rest of the module is not difficult to implement.

Hi Suhail
How would you approach the below?

New form (This will be saved to the database, these can be edited later if needed..)
- nested form 1 which accepts a dictionary (key: string -- value: list of strings) --> settings
- nested form 2 which accepts a few strings and one method to open pdf/docs saving the data to a string

The tech stack will be Django, django template with html/css/js/jquery.

Regards.
Daniel

---------------------------------------
what i want is

Job form
- job position
- job application date
- nested form 1 which is keywords,
example..
keyword 1 - string 1, string 2, string 3
keyword 2 - string 4, string 6, string 7, string 5,
keyword 3 - string 5,

- nested form 2 which is for the applicants..
name
resume (text fields) or docs,pdf which will be converted to a string to be saved in the database.

for both nested forms, users should be able to add as many forms they like.

-----------------------
didn't add the navbar into the wireframe, but do create one generic navbar which is applicable for all pages.
1st page - dashboard... from the table, there is the Action buttons..
if they click edit, it will lead to the 2nd page but with all data.
if they click view, it will lead to the 3rd page which is the result page

2nd page - form to add new job

i'm still working on the third page which is the result page..
